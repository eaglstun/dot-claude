# MSL address spaces (device / constant / threadgroup / thread)

Source (Apple): Metal Shading Language Specification, §4–4.4.1, §4.8 (v4.1, 2026-06-04).
PDF: <https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Shading-Language-Specification.pdf>
(The MSL language rules are only in the spec PDF — there is no DocC HTML/JSON page for
them, so this was extracted from the PDF, not the usual DocC-JSON endpoint.)

Address spaces are **disjoint regions with access restrictions**, and they are part of the
pointer's type:

- Every pointer/reference declaration needs an explicit address-space attribute — a missing
  one is a **compilation error**.
- Every pointer/reference **argument to a kernel function** must be `device`,
  `constant`, `threadgroup`, or `threadgroup_imageblock`.
- There are no address-space casts: the spaces are disjoint, so a `threadgroup char*`
  cannot become a `device char*` etc. (Reinterpreting _element type_ within one space —
  e.g. `(const threadgroup char4*)&tile[i]` — is ordinary pointer casting and fine if
  alignment holds.)
- A variable at **program scope** must be in the `constant` address space.

## device (§4.1)

Buffer memory, **readable and writable**. Declared as pointer/reference to scalar, vector,
or user-defined struct; the Metal API call that allocates the `MTLBuffer` determines the
actual size (the kernel just sees a pointer). This is the space for anything sized at
runtime — all tensor data.

## constant (§4.2)

Buffer memory, **read-only** (writing is a compile-time error). Two distinct uses:

1. **Program-scope variables** must live here and must be **initialized at declaration
   with a core constant expression** (C++17 §5.20 — compile-time evaluable). Declaring one
   uninitialized is a compile-time error. Values persist across all function invocations
   in the program.
2. **Kernel arguments**: pointers/references to `constant` are allowed as function
   arguments. The spec (this version) imposes no compile-time-known-size rule on such
   buffers; the stated constraint is a GPU-dependent **minimum offset alignment** ("Minimum
   constant buffer offset alignment", Metal Feature Set Tables).

Use `constant` for data that is uniform across the dispatch and read by all threads
(scalars, small parameter blocks) — the hardware can broadcast/cache it; `device` reads are
optimized for per-thread divergent access.

## thread (§4.3)

Per-thread memory. Every variable declared inside a kernel/graphics function lives here and
is invisible to other threads. `thread float* p = &x;` is the explicit spelling.

## threadgroup (§4.4)

Memory shared by the threads of one threadgroup, "faster on most devices than sharing data
in device memory". Used to (a) declare a variable inside a kernel (`threadgroup float
tile[10];`) or (b) take a kernel parameter `threadgroup float* p [[threadgroup(0)]]` whose
size the host sets with `setThreadgroupMemoryLength:atIndex:`. Lifetime = the threadgroup's
execution of the kernel. §4.4.1 (SIMD-groups within a threadgroup) is summarized in
`threadgroup-and-simdgroup-synchronization.md`.

## The others (not relevant to this backend)

- `threadgroup_imageblock` (§4.5) — tile-shading imageblocks; no render passes here.
- `ray_data` (§4.6) — ray-tracing intersection payloads; not used.
- `object_data` (§4.7) — mesh-shader object→mesh payloads; not used.

## Memory coherency (§4.8)

`thread` memory has thread coherence, `threadgroup` memory threadgroup coherence, and
`device` memory **threadgroup coherence by default** — writes to a device buffer are only
guaranteed visible across _different_ threadgroups if marked `coherent(device)` (Metal
3.2+) and properly synchronized. The backend's kernels never communicate across
threadgroups within a dispatch, so the default suffices.

### Worked example: the CTranslate2 Metal backend

All in `src/metal/kernels/kernels_msl.h`, dispatched from `src/metal/primitives.mm` and
`src/metal/gemm.mm`:

- **Arrays are `device`, host scalars are `constant T&`** — the file-wide signature
  pattern: `ct2_softmax_float(device const float* input …, constant uint& depth …)`,
  `ct2_gemm_s8(device const char* a …, constant uint& m …, constant int& alpha …)`. The
  `constant uint&` args pair with host-side `[encoder setBytes:&depth_u
length:sizeof(depth_u) atIndex:3]` (`primitives.mm`) — setBytes data lands in the
  constant address space, no `MTLBuffer` needed. See
  `compute-kernels-and-dispatch.md` for the encoder side.
- **Program-scope tuning constants** use rule (1): `constant uint CT2_SOFTMAX_TG = 256;`,
  `CT2_NORM_TG`, `CT2_QUANT_TG`, `CT2_GEMM_S8_BM/BN/BK` — compile-time initialized at
  program scope, as required.
- **Threadgroup tiles**: the int8 GEMM stages operands as `threadgroup char
As[CT2_GEMM_S8_BK][CT2_GEMM_S8_BM]` / `Bs[…]`, and the reductions declare
  `threadgroup float scratch[256]` inside the kernel (variant (a) — sized in-source, not
  host-bound, so no `[[threadgroup(n)]]` argument or `setThreadgroupMemoryLength` is
  involved).
- **In-space element reinterpretation** is load-bearing in the int8 kernels:
  `(const threadgroup char4*)(&As[kk][tid.y * 4u])` and `(device const char4*)(a +
(ulong)i * lda)` — legal because the address space is unchanged and the host routes only
  alignment-safe shapes to `ct2_gemv_s8` (the kernel's comment says so). What you can NOT
  do is cast between spaces.
- Helper functions show the parameter rule: `ct2_rms_norm_impl(device const T* input, …,
threadgroup float* scratch)` — non-kernel functions can take any address space, but
  every pointer still names one explicitly.
