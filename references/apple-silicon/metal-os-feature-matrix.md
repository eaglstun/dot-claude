# Metal feature ↔ version ↔ OS floor — the matrix that stops version-guessing

Sources: each row cites either an existing reference in this skill (which carries the
original Apple citation) or a DocC platform stamp fetched 2026-06-11
(`MTLFunctionConstantValues`, `MTLGPUFamily.metal3`, `MTLGPUFamily.metal4`,
`MTLBinaryArchive`, `MTLIOCommandQueue`, `MTLBlitCommandEncoder` pages). Repo facts from
`CMakeLists.txt` and `src/metal/` read the same day.

"-era" floors are inferred from the Metal version, not from a fetched platform stamp —
treat them as approximate; the MSL-version column is the authoritative gate (the spec
states MSL versions, not macOS versions). Hardware gates are separate from OS gates:
`simdgroup_matrix` needs Apple7+, which every Apple Silicon Mac satisfies (M1 = apple7,
M2 = apple8, M3/M4 = apple9 — `mtlgpufamily-and-feature-availability.md`).

## Deployment reality: what THIS repo requires today

Verified by grep on 2026-06-11:

- **Build gate:** `CMakeLists.txt` (`if (WITH_METAL)`) requires only APPLE + arm64 and
  links Metal/MPS/Foundation. No deployment-target pin, no Metal-version compile flag.
- **Runtime gate:** none. `src/metal/device.mm` checks only that a default
  `MTLDevice` exists; there is no `supportsFamily`, `@available`, or
  `__builtin_available` anywhere in `src/metal/`.
- **Features actually used:** MPSMatrix-family GEMM, runtime `newLibraryWithSource` with
  a default-init `MTLCompileOptions`, Shared buffers, and MSL kernels whose newest
  language dependency is SIMD-group reductions (`simd_sum` / `simd_shuffle_down` —
  Metal 2-era). Nothing from the macOS 13+/15+/26 rows is load-bearing.
- **Implicit floor (inference, not a measurement):** any Apple Silicon Mac ≈ M1 /
  macOS 11. But the backend has only ever run on one machine — the M4 Max (apple9,
  macOS 26.x per `mtlgpufamily-and-feature-availability.md`) — so the floor is untested.

## How to use this card

- Before reaching for a row's feature, open the cited reference — it carries the sharp
  edges (e.g. `atomic_float` is add/sub-only; `simdgroup_matrix` has no int8 element
  type; `mathMode` defaults to _relaxed_ on Apple silicon).
- If a change starts using anything at macOS 13.0 or later, that is the moment the
  backend's "no availability checks" stance breaks: add the `supportsFamily` /
  `@available` assert listed in `mtlgpufamily-and-feature-availability.md` rather than
  letting older systems fail at first dispatch.
- macOS-26-only surfaces (`MTLTensor`, MPP) are evaluation targets, not portable code
  paths — anything shipped on them needs a fallback to the current kernels.

### Worked example: the CTranslate2 Metal backend

- `CMakeLists.txt` (the `WITH_METAL` block) and `src/metal/device.mm` are the only
  places version policy could live today — both are version-silent, which is exactly why
  this index exists: the floor is implicit and easy to break accidentally.
- The int8 path's future options ladder reads straight off the matrix:
  `MPSNDArrayQuantizedMatrixMultiplication` (macOS 15) and MPP `matmul2d` (macOS 26) vs
  the version-free hand-tiled `ct2_gemm_s8` in `src/metal/kernels/kernels_msl.h`.
- When a benchmark or hardening pass pins down a real floor (e.g. CI on an M1), record
  it here and in `mtlgpufamily-and-feature-availability.md`.
